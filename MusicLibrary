Webpage of a music library database using PHP, HTML and CSS, with SQL and XAMPP: users could register and sign in, add music to the library, and listen to added music (via links, if they were provided). The website listed the most listened to songs, and users can search songs by artist, genre, or name.

The website is in Hungarian language, and the PDF file was written in Hungarian.

Note: the variable types underlined with red lines should be the same type, else some bugs can appear. I fixed this later in the database.
